spraytag
==========

A version of CrystalMV's Drawtag that supports texture data sharing and latent loading.


###Features
* Draw tags on walls & floor using a spraycan
* Stores images clientsided and one texture is downloaded only once.
* Suitable for RPG-type servers where multiple instances of a handful of tags are to be sprayed (e.g. gangs, etc having one type of tag each, sprayed multiple times)
* Textures are uploaded using latent events, preventing freezes and nuisance
* Tag drawing etc. features have been removed as they conflict with the intent of the modification.

###Known Bugs
* None for the time being, be sure to report if you find any

###To-Do
* Implement checksum verification

###Credits
Special thanks to CrystalMV for developing what is one of the most complicated resources of MTA in an organized and successful manner :)
